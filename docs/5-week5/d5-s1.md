# Testing Python Code

## Intro to OOP recap

We are going to start the lesson with going through [this Data Camp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python)

## Testing intro

There are many different types of system testing. If you search the Internet for the "types of testing," you will find over a hundred different types.

There are numerous reasons for having such a range. However, the main reason is the fact that testing is important and expensive. Modern researchers agree that the average cost of software quality is between 30 and 50% of the total cost of development and total engineering effort (Ebert and Dumke, 2010). You can read more about the cost of testing and the cost of quality in the book by Ebert and Dumke available at Northeastern library. Chapter 8.3.4 on page 222 has some interesting statistics related to testing.

## Types of Testing

Some of the most important types of testing are summarised below:

## Automated Testing

Many consider that there are only two main testing methodologies. They are:

- Manual testing
- Automated testing

Manual testing is a process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tools. Such process can be time-consuming, often slower than automated testing and can sometimes be more costly. Manual testing is performed by professional testers who carry out actions that will be performed by the future users step by step.

Some advantages of manual testing are:

- No programming knowledge is required to test
- No extra software required which can save money
- Easier to learn than automated
- No maintenance of automation scripts

### Automation testing

Automation/automated testing is done by using tools such as test scripts that automate test execution. In this type of testing execution of same script can be done multiples times when new features or functionality is added.

Some advantages of automated testing are:

- Test can run anytime, e.g., at night
- Same tests can be repeated with no extra effort
- Fast execution of tests
- Test can be run in multiple environments at same time
- Early bug detection

## Test Driven Development - TDD

TDD stands for Test Driven Development. It is a development practice, not testing as such. However, its impact on preventing bugs can be huge. Moreover, the best way to explain unit tests is via a TDD practical. In the process of TDD developers follow steps diagrammed below:

## TDD with [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html)

**Documentation and testing** are the two most critical components of software development projects.

Python‚Äôs standard library comes with a mini testing and documentation framework module called [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

Its testing capability is very basic and is reported to be imprecise (some tests give wrong results sometimes).
