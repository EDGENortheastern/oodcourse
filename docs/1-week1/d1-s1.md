# Introduction to GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online service that developers use to store their code and to collaborate.

GitHub has a range of useful features:

- Issues and Projects for project planning
- Pull Requests to merge comtributions from different team members
- Insights to measure contributions from different team members
- Actions to automate pipelines
- Options to review each other's code

## Some noteworthy GitHubs

## Markdown

Markdown is a very simple computer language.
It is not sophisticated enough to build apps,
but it is easily the best way to style text on the web.
There are several flavours of the Markdown language.
The one we focus on is known as the [GitHub flavour](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Good Markdown follows [rules](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/main/docs/RULES.md)
just like any other computer language. Please follow them.

### Headers

You can add headers to the article using the format below.
> ⚠️ There **_must_** be a space between the first word and the last hash
or pound sign.

```markdown
# H1 - use one hashtag to make the top-level header
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
```

### Emphasis

Add emphasis to the article using the format below

- The emphasis, aka italics, with `*asterisks*` or `_underscores_`
  - *asterisks* or _underscores_
- The strong emphasis, aka bold, with `**asterisks**` or `__underscores__`
  - **asterisks** or __underscores__
- The combined emphasis with `**asterisks and _underscores_**`
  - **asterisks and _underscores_**
- The strikethrough uses two tildes `~~Scratch this~~`
  - ~~Scratch this~~

### Blockquotes

Add quotes to the article using the format below:

``` markdown
> Add the angle bracket `>` to add an indent to the quote in the article
```

> Add the angle bracket `>` to add an indent to the quote in the article

```markdown
> Quotes spread one line apart
> will be shown in the same quote.
```

> Quotes spread one line apart
> will be shown in the same quote

### Lists

To produce numbered lists, add a number (any numbers would work,
but all 1s are common) followed by a dot and a space
at the start of the line:

```markdown
1. Numbers create
1. An ordered list
1. In the article
```

1. Numbers create
1. An ordered list
1. In the article

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD004 -->

```markdown
* Unordered lists can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

* Unordered lists can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD004 -->

To create a nested list add two spaces to its starting position.

```markdown
- The first line
  - The indented line
- The next line
```

- The first line
  - The indented line
- The next line

### Images

You can add an image to the Markdown body using the format below

```markdown
![alt text](file URL)
```

For example, to include this image

![Image example](/img/icons/github-logo.svg)

the following Markdown was used:
