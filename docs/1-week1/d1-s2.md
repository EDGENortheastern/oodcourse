# Python introduction

## Python

[Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) created Python in the late 1980s.

People like calling Python a general-purpose programming language. One can use Python's modules and libraries for a wide range of purposes:

- Mathematics and Statistics
  - SciPi
  - NumPy
- Data analysis and manipulation
  - Pandas
- Data visualisation
  - Matplotlib
  - Plotly
- Artificial Intelligenc/Machine Learning
  - scikit-learn
  - PyTorch
- Parallel processing
  - PySpark
- Web Development
  - Django
  - Flask
- DevOps

## Python 2, Python 3

Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020. Its updates - including security updates - have stopped being released.

Python 3 was released in 2008; however, its adoption was very slow. As a result, you can still find some examples of code written in Python 2 on the internet. Make sure to check the version of Python when you search the internet for code examples.

Here is some Python 2:

```python
print 'Hello world!!'
```

This course focuses on *Python3 only*.

## Deepnote

[Deepnote](https://docs.deepnote.com/) is a free online Python notebook.

Deepnotes run in the cloud, so you do not have to download any software. We will also show how to run Python on your local machine later. Deepnote notebooks are compatible with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/https://jupyter.org/).

### Duplicating Deepnotes

‚ö†Ô∏è Most cloud resources we share are open to view; some allow executing code.
However, to make changes, you **must** make your copy, i.e., fork or duplicate.

### Your first Deepnote wih tasks

We will use Deepnotes to demonstrate Python skills and to set practice tasks.

Duplicate the Deepnote below, run or re-run the cells and try the tasks (signposted üèãÔ∏è).

## Variables

> A variable is a unique identifier associated with a priamry memory location. It can store values that can change when the program runs.

Let's decypher the above.

- "An idntifier" means a name
- The name of a variable has to be unique
- A variable is linked with an address in computer memory
- Where values can be stored
- Those values can change

```python
my_number = 3 # defines variable my_number
print(my_number) # prints variable my_number
my_number = my_number+5 # changes variable my_number, incerements it by 5
```

## Rules for variable names

- names can not start with a number
- names can not contain spaces, use _ intead
- names can not contain any of these symbols: `:'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+`
- it's considered best practice ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)) that names are lowercase with underscores
- you must not use Python built-in keywords like `list` and `str`
- avoid using the single characters `l` (lowercase letter el), `O` (uppercase letter oh) and `I` (uppercase letter eye) as they can be confused with `1` and `0`

## Data types

Python variables can be of the following data types:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | -: |
| Integer  | int | Whole numbers, e.g., 32, 5, -20  |
| Float  | float | Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 1.2, -3.2 |
| String  | str | Strings of characters, text, e.g., "hello" |
| Boolean  | bool | True or False |
| List  | list | Ordered collections of values, e.g., `[23,"hello",4.5]` |
| Dictionary  | dict | Unordered key-value pairs, e.g., `{name: "Alex", age: 21}` |
| Tuple  | tup | Unchangeable (immutable) collections, e.g., `(2,3)`|
| Set  | set | Collections of unique value, e.g., `{"a","b"}`|

## Representing Strings

Strings in Python can be enclosed either with single quotes like `'hello'` or double quotes, like `"hello"`.

Mixed quotes can help output an apostrophe.

```python
# Notice that the single quote ' is surrounded by
# double quotes, ""
greeting = "Hello, it's Alex"
```

Strings can be printed out using the `print()` function in Python.

```python
>>> print("Hello ")
Hello
>>> name = "Alex"
>>> print(name)
Alex
```

A quick way to print the value of multiple variables without formatting them is to pass them into the `print()` method as comma-separated values. This will print the value of each variable separated by a space.

```python
>>> name = "Alex"
>>> print("Hello", name)
Hello Alex
```

### Concatenation

Strings can be **concatenated** (added together) using the `+` operator. For example:

```python
salutation = "Hello "
name = "Alex"
greeting = salutation + name
# The value of greeting will be "Hello Alex"
```

## Dynamic Typing

Python uses *dynamic typing*, meaning you can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types; it differs from other languages that are *statically typed*.
