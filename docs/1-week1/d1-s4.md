# D1S4. Introduction to Data

[Slides](https://hackmd.io/@D3o17PKxQImUPBfYYD6wYg/HkJ7lj3go#/1)

Data works are generally grouped into:

1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analytics
3. Data Science

---

## Data engineers

Data engineers build information storage systems and custom data pipelines. They design databases to collect and store data while also making it easy to process.

See how the popularity of this profession has changed in the last twenty years on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=data%20engineer).

---

## Data engineers' toolbox

Data engineers are proficient in all kinds of database languages and frameworks, e.g., all types of SQL. They use programming languages like Java, Scala, or Python to process data and command-line languages such as Shell to automate the workflow.

---

## Data analysts

Data analysts describe and explore data. They focus on data preparation, visualization, and summative reports.

## Data analysts' toolbox

Data analysts use the querying features of the SQL language to retrieve and aggregate data from existing databases. They may use spreadsheets to perform simple analyses on smaller datasets. Analysts also use Business Intelligence (BI) tools, such as Tableau or Power BI, to create dashboards. Python and R are other increasingly common tools for cleaning and analyzing data.

## Data scientists

Data scientists use machine and deep learning tools for classification, prediction, and hypothesis testing. They do advanced data exploration, visualization, experimentation, and prediction.

## Data scientists' toolbox

Data scientists must be proficient in SQL and Python or R. They use popular data science libraries, such as pandas (Python) or tidyverse (R). Traditional machine learning also requires libraries such as scikit-learn or PyTorch. Deep learning experts might use TensorFlow to run powerful deep learning algorithms or Keras to work with neural networks.

## Data workflow

To sum up, many data projects have four stages:

1. Data collection, e.g., conveying surveys, gathering data from social media (Big Data), acquiring transactional data.

2. Data preparation, e.g., "cleaning data," such as removing duplicate values or finding missing ones, converting pieces of data into a consistent and easy to process format.

3. Data exploration, e.g., visualization, obtaining descriptive statistics such as mean and median.

4. Running experiments and predictions on the data, e.g., forecasting sales.

Data analysis focuses on the two middle stages: data preparation and data exploration. That is not to say that our course is limited to those two. We will look into database design and predictive data science too. However, first things first.

## Data workflow workshop

We copied and pasted some data about the [richest people](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#5aaf70953d78) from the Internet into a Google Sheet.

Steps:

1. Open the Google Sheet linked below
2. Make a copy (File -> Make a copy)
3. Follow the instructions in Sheets: Data Preparation, Data Exploration and Data Visualization.

We also made a Deepnote for the same data work:
