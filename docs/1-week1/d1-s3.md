# D1S3. Introduction to GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online service that developers use to store their code and to collaborate.

GitHub has a range of useful features:

- Issues and Projects for project planning
- Pull Requests to merge comtributions from different team members
- Insights to measure contributions from different team members
- Actions to automate pipelines
- Options to review each other's code

## Some noteworthy GitHubs

### [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds)

The green dots on a profile page show contributions. The creator of Linux contributes to his six reposiories almost every day.

The repository for Linux was starred a lot.

### [A data repository](https://github.com/n-gao/gapminder)

Have a look around [this repository](https://github.com/n-gao/gapminder). It is a data project that recreates [Hans Rosling's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) Wealth and Health visualization.

In the top right corner you can find a published app, in the codebase some `.csv` files with data.

The reposiory is well documented with a README.

If you navigate to the owner's profile you will also find a pinned repo with Jupyter notebook research and a link to a published paper.

## The tasks

1. Have a think and discuss what is good and what is not so good about the data visualisation in [this repository](https://github.com/n-gao/gapminder).

2. Make a Pull Request to add information about you to the readme of this repository. You will need to use Markdown.
