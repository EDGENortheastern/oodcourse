# Python constructs

There are three main programming constructs:

1. Sequence (every line is executed in order, no indentation)
2. Selection (`if` and some other statements)
3. Iteration (loops, repetition)

## Indentation

Python is driven by code indentation and whitespace. Code readability is a core part of the Python language.

Compulsory indentation makes debugging difficult for beginners.

Indented blocks follow colons in `if` statements and others.

## if, elif, else statements

`if` statements in Python allow telling the computer to perform alternative actions depending on a condition.

Verbally, we can imagine we are telling the computer:
Hey if this case happens, perform some action, otherwise perform some other action"

`elif` means **else if**. It means, **if** this `if` statement isn't `True`, try this **instead.**

You can have as many `elif` statements in your code as you want. They get evaluated in the order that they're declared **until** Python finds one that is `True`. That runs the code defined in that `elif`, and skips the rest.

### Fake chatbot task

Making conversational apps as below helps to understand `if-elif-else` beter.
Press ▶ to run the code. You can also change the code and reset.

### Working in [replit](https://replit.com/)

Deepnote is not ideal for interacting with the user. For Python programs that involve user interactions, we will demo code in replit, a cloud code playground.

Fork the replit below, making sure you have signed up to [replit](https://replit.com/). **Sign up with your GitHub account.**

⚠️ If you sign up to replit with your GitHub credentials your Python portfolio will look much better and employers will headhunt **you** (eventually).

## Python Loops

Sometimes you need to repeat exactly the same lines of code.

Loops make code shorter and less repetitive.

### For loop

`for i in range()` allows to repeat the same lines of code a set number of times.

### While loop

`WHILE` loop repeats code until a condition is met.

## Flowcharts

Flowcharts visualise programming constructs. Flowcharts use stanard symbols.

You can create flowcharts with [figma](https://www.figma.com/).
We recommend signing up to [figma](https://www.figma.com/) with your GitHub account.

## The task

1. In pairs make a flowchart for program that guesses one's password.
2. Write the code to match your flwochart (use replit or deepnote).
3. Make a Pull Request to the `README` of this repo with your code and chart:
