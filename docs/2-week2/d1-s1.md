# SDLC

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dvu4aG99uOTNAvecURzDnlgsCZN7IUH9/edit#slide=id.p1)

## Intro to SDLC

[System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fi3_BjVzpqk) is a
conceptual model. It describes the stages organisations typically follow to:

- plan
- design
- build
- test
- deliver
- and maintain

software applications or entire information systems.

SDLC provides a set of steps to create an end-product. The end-product of SDLC can be:

- Only hardware
- Only software
- Both hardware and software

## Types of System Lifecycles

System lifecycles can be:

- [Linear](#linear-system-lifecycles)
- Iterative

### Linear System Lifecycles

Linear lifecycles are considered traditional and somewhat old-fashioned.

They are based on a step-by-step approach.

Each step needs to be completed, agreed and signed-off before the next step can be started.

The final step of a linear cycle is often the implementation of the system into the live environment, the deployment. Sometimes the deployment is succeeded by the maintenance of the system. Maintenance continues until the product is replaced with a newer version or deprecated. Conversely, in iterative cycles the deployment happens from the start of the project and is done continuously.

The ‘Waterfall’ lifecycle is a classic example of the linear lifecycle.

A linear approach is suitable when:

- the requirements are well understood
- the requirements are agreed in detail in advance
- the requirements are very unlikely to change
- the agreement with the client requires formal reviews by the system producers and users at every stage
- the development process must be guided by detailed formal documentation (e.g., military contracts)
- the development costs have to be split
- the project is very smalls

Lifecycles that follow the linear approach are:

- Waterfall
- V-model
- Incremental

### Advantages of the linear approach

- The problem is broken down into distinct steps with clear goals
- Everything is agreed in advance with the client
- Outsourced or distributed development is easier
- Easier to conduct when the design specification is fixed, rigid
- Easier to budget
- Simpler for very small problems

### Disadvantages of the linear approach

- Challenging to go back one step
- Time-consuming
- Does not accommodate changing requirements
- No value is created until the project is fully finished

### Waterfall SDLC

The most famous linear lifecycle is **‘Waterfall.’** It was introduced in the 1970s. Though it was largely replaced with the Agile approach later on, it continues to be widely discussed and studied.

**Waterfall SDLC** is a sequence of steps or stages that cascade down. The main principle of the Waterfall cycle is: each step must be completed before the next step starts.

The Waterfall diagram is below. The dotted lines and arrows on the diagram show that if a problem occurs at any of the steps, the development process must go a step back to fix it.

#### Waterfall's strengths

- Good for developing systems with clearly pre-defined requirements that are unlikely to change
- Control around each stage makes it easier to manage the project, with obvious project milestones (breaks in development)
- Simple to understand due to rigidity of the stages

#### Waterfall's weaknesses

- It is difficult to make changes
- It is almost impossible to change the requirements especially at later stages
- No value is produced until the entire project is deployed
- Poor estimation leads to huge increases in cost and time
- Minimal end-user involvement throughout the project

### The V-model

The V-model is an extension to the Waterfall model. It targets the problem that time for testing often ends up reduced during a Waterfall project. The shape of the diagram of the V-model looks like the letter “V.” Project definition tasks appear on the left of the “V”, whereas verification and validation tasks on the right. The “V”- model aligns each stage of the project creation with a stage or a type of testing.

### The Extended ‘V’ model

The Extended ‘V’ model introduces some extra stages that allow for measuring and testing the business benefits of the new system.. The Feasibility Study becomes the first stage and the Benefits Realisation stage - the final stage of the verification and validation period.

## Iterative lifecycles

In an iterative lifecycle the overall project is composed of several small time-boxed developments, called iterations, which take place in sequence.

Each iteration is a self-contained project composed of activities such as requirements elicitation, analysis, design, development and test. They can be seen as linear mini-projects. Requirements are specified during each iteration.

The understanding of the overall solution evolves as the requirements change.

Iterative development is often combined with an incremental delivery approach and is referred to as Iterative Incremental Delivery.

### Strengths of Iterative lifecycles

- Requirements evolve through iterations
- Collaboration with the users, customer satisfaction is higher
- Change is easier to manage
- Costs can be controlled

### Weaknesses of Iterative lifecycles

- Hard to manage due to multiple iterations and teams
- Without careful management, the requirements grow too much
- Overall costs can be higher due to the additional integration testing across multiple teams and iterations

## The Agile

Agile is a popular term given to evolutionary development approaches following the [‘Agile Manifesto’ of 2001](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.htmlLinks).

[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.htmlLinks) led to a whole new way of thinking about software development. Linear lifecycles such as Waterfall, V-model and Incremental fell out of favour in place of more evolutionary approaches such as Scrum and the Agile Unified Process.

The Agile has become the most popular approach to system development in the process of evolution summarised below:

1. 1986 - Spiral method
1. 1991 - RAD (rapid application development)
1. 1994 - DSDM (The Dynamic Systems Development Method)
1. 1995 - SCRUM 
1. 1996 - XP (extreme programming)
1. 1999 - RUP (The Rational Unified Process)
1. 2001 - Agile manifesto
