# Pair-programming and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a web of ueser generated coding challenges.
You will be solving some whilst practicing pair programming.
It would help to sign up to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) early.

## Extreme programming (XP)

Pair programming originated from [Extreme programming (XP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), one of the agile methodologies developed in the 90s. XP is an agile framework. In essence, it is about good practices taken to an extreme, e.g., "if pair programming is good, let's always do it."

XP as a framework is suitable when:

- Software requirements change dynamically
- Small teams at a single location
- Automated testing is possible
- Fixe-time projects cause risks

## Pair programming

Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work [together at one workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

The advantages of pair programming are:

- Fewer bugs
- Bugs caught early
- Learning from each other
- Learning to respect each other
- Less stress per dev
- Collaboration: better, more efficient code
- Collaboration, better quality code (more readable, adhering to good style)
- Collaboration, two juniors can solve a mid-level task together

## Driver and navigator

There are many models of pair programming. One of them is called **"Driver and Navigator."**

The Driver is the person at the keyboard. They focus on details and smaller goals. A driver should talk and explain what they are doing.

The Navigator is the observer, while the Driver is typing. They give directions, and spot bugs, e.g., typos.

When the task gets very challenging, the Driver and the Navigator freestyle to find the best solution. Talk, draw, jump. Don't fight, though.

## Task 1

1. Split into pairs and try driver-navigator model on the following challenge:

2. Python data types: [String to integer](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54fdadc8762e2e51e400032c/python)

3. Swap roles:

4. Python data types: [Find data type](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a5bfaa756cfede78000026/python)

Choose some kata from this [curated list](https://www.codewars.com/collections/python-beginner-katas-comprehensive) and pair prgram some solutions.

## Task 2

Clone the repo below and pair program to complete the tickets:
