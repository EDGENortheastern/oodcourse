## Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a set of skills that enable people solve complex problems.

Computational problem-solving always starts with data as the input.
The output is not only a solution to a problem but a process for arriving at it. Computational thinking makes sure the process can be replicated and others can reuse it.

Computational thinking is based on four main ideas:

1. Decomposition - breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts

2. Pattern Recognition -analyzing data and identifying similarities and connections among its different parts

3. Abstraction - identifying the most relevant information needed to solve the problem. removing extra details

4. Algorithmic Thinking - developing a step-by-step process to solve the problem so that the work is replicable by humans or/and computers

Algorithmic Thinking is tightly linked with programming paradigms, traditional styles, or ways of programming.

## Programming paradigms

A non-exhaustive list of contemporary programming paradigms is below:

- Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands.
- Procedural: imperative with function calls.
- Declarative: Programming by specifying the result a user wants, instead of how to get it.
- Functional: Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
- Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other.
- Event-Driven: Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.

We will consider imperative, procedural, OOP, and functional programming.

However, we already know a lot about declarative vs imperative/procedural. Let's sum up.

## Imperative/procedural programming

Pure Python (also known as Python standard library) is often used in an imperative or procedural way.

For example, we can find out the maximum value in a data frame column 'Space Flights' of the astronauts data set in this (imperative) way:

```python
max_val = 0
for i, j in df[['Space Flights']].iterrows():
    print(j.values)
    if j.values[0] > max_val:
        max_val = j.values[0]
```

`.iterrows()` is a Pandas version of a for loop, it allows to iterate through a data frame.

The code uses a classic algorithm for finding a maximum value. Here is the same algorithm used for a list:

```python
my_list = [2,3,47,11,23,567,45,3] # defines a Python list
max_val = 0 # define a vairable for maximum value
for num in my_list: # iterate through list
    if num>max_val: # compare the variable with the current array value
        max_val=num # overwrite the maximum value with the current value in a list
print(max_val)
```

> The difference between procedural and imperative coding is the use of functions.

## Functions in Python

To sum up a part of Monday's session: the difference between imperial and procedural coding is the existence of functions. An old school name for some types of functions is "procedures." Functions are also sometimes called subroutines.

A function is a block of code that is written under a name, an identifier. The code inside a function will **not run** unless a function is called.

A function is called by its name. The function is defined with the keyword def. Let us exemplify.

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2
```

Above is the definition of the function subtract_nums. `num_1` and `num_2` are parameters of the function. There are no errors in the function definition, however, it will not run until:

```python
print(subtract_nums(50, 5)) # calls function subtract_nums with parameters 50 and 5.
```

You can assign the result of a function call to a variable:

```python
difference = subtract_nums(100, 10)
print(difference)
```

You can use variables as parameters:

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2

first_num = -2 # creates a variable, assigns a value to it
second_num = 190 # creates a variable, assigns a value to it

print(subtract_nums(first_num, second_num)) # uses variables as parameters
```
