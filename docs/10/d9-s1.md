# Bringing it all together

## UI design

The UI design is different from the UX design.

The UI design is about how a product looks, whereas the UX is how somebody uses it.

Even though the UI designers focus more on the product's looks, they draw upon UX designers' research, so the two types of design are closely interlinked.

Some features of good UI design are:

- Elements perform predictably
- Interfaces are simple
- Color, brightness and contrast are user-friendly, accessible
- Text can be understood by scanning
- Brand consistency
- High discoverability, e.g., buttons have outlines

## UX design

A UX designer prioritizes empathy and compassion over looks. It is not uncommon for UX designers to have a psychology or data background rather than design.

A typical UX workflow:

- Defining the need
- [Gaining insights](#gaining-insights)
- [Ideation](#ideation)
- Creating [user flows](#user-flow)
- [Lo-fi prototyping](#wireframing)
- [Hi-fi prototyping](#hi-fi-prototyping)
- Design testing, e.g., A/B testing

## Gaining Insights

UX teams conduct thorough research before drafting any actual designs. Research methods include:

- Prospective user interviews
- Focus group interviews
- Surveys
- Competitors research

## Ideation

UX teams then analyze research and produce:

- User personas
- User journeys
- User pain points
- Empathy maps
- etc.

### User personas

User personas help find the answer to one of their most important questions, “Who are we designing for?” They are fictional characters, imaginary customers.

Personas help UX designers **empathize** with the users to design a better product. Hence, frustrations are often listed in a persona description.

Below is an example of a user persona:

<img
    src="/img/ui/user-persona.png"
    class="medium screenshot"
    alt="A user persona example"
/>

### User stories

User stories are derived from user personas. A product team usually creates user stories. Atlassian's Jira, a leading project management tool, advocates the following user story template:

> As a [type of user], I want to do [X], so that I can [achieve goal X].

Stories are less verbose and less creative than personas and will often have precise hi-fi screen mockups attached to them.

## User Flow

User journeys and user flow diagrams are tools that describe the process of interaction between a user and a product.

User and task flow diagrams are simple flowcharts.

A user journey considers not only the steps that a user takes but also their feelings, pain points, and excitements.

The app called Miro has templates for all flow diagrams. The user journey one is particulalry useful:

## Wireframing

A wireframe is a low-fidelity, two-dimensional visual representation of a product layout, e.g., an app interface.

Low fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes can be hand-drawn. They are always simple, without user interactions, and do not have details such as colors or fonts.

UX (user experience) professionals often start with wireframes to plan features, screen flow and intended user interactions with the product.

Below is an example of a lo-fi screen mockup:

<img
    src="/img/ui/product_details.svg"
    class="screenshot"
    alt="A wireframe example"
/>

Figma is a common, free prototyping tool. We recommend signing up with [your personal email](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039811114-Create-a-Figma-account) so that you have access to your Figmas forever.

You can easily duplicate other people's Figmas to save their copies for yourself:

<img
    src="/img/ui/duplicate-team-figma.png"
    class="medium screenshot"
    alt="Duplicating Figma"
/>

A Figma frame is one of the best options for starting individual screen mockups, whether high or low fidelity.

You can create a new Figma frame this way:

<img
    src="/img/ui/figma-frame.png"
    class="narrow screenshot"
    alt="Creating a Figma frame"
/>

However, with Frame Tool selected, you can also choose pre-set frame options for various mobile and desktop screens:

<img
    src="/img/ui/frame-options.png"
    class="wide screenshot"
    alt="Creating a Figma frame"
/>

To start learning Figma is better with a wireframe.

Duplicate the lo-fi Figma below and add new screen mockups to the app. Use frames for screens. You will need to adjust the dimensions if you choose a pre-set frame.

## Hi-fi prototyping

High-fidelity mockups are fully designed layouts. They are usually based on previously approved and user-tested lo-fi prototypes.

The hi-fi prototype below can be explored as an actual app. To do so, click the play button in the top right corner.

## Product work

A product owner is a Scrum team role. However, as the role is becoming increasingly important nowadays, organisations tend to have Product teams that are responsible for the project's outcome and for collaboration with the client.

In a nutshell, Product team writes the tickets, whereas Test team writes test cases.

## Test Cases vs Acceptance Criteria

A test case is a document describing input, action, and expected output determining if an application feature works appropriately. It is a set of instructions on “HOW” to validate a particular test objective. On the other hand, acceptance criteria are predefined requirements; they specify “WHAT” the system should do. They are agile requirements documentation. Before the testing team can write test cases, the product owners, the business, or the clients need to write a detailed user story with acceptance criteria.

Acceptance Criteria are written on tickets, tickets are called issues on GitHub and can be grouped on a GitHub Project, e.g., [here](Acceptance Criteria).

Test cases are a part of manual testing and can be written using [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zmuULzQS4Eowo-4YRzq1mh08hqOgREPO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110458079117642901067&rtpof=true&sd=true).
