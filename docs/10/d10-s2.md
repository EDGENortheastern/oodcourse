# More Django üîó‚Äçüí•

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework.

Read more about the framework on [Django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/).

## Django workflow to a GitHub repo

Make a remote repository (GitHub), clone to your local, for example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EDGENortheastern/django-intro.git
```

Navigate into it:

```bash
cd django-intro
```

Make a virtualenv called `myvenv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

Activate `myvenv`. By the way [this page](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/#working-with-virtualenv) has some ideas on what to do if `activate` does not work.

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Make sure we have the latest version of `pip`, the software that we use to install:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Inside the main project folder, make a file called `requirements.txt` and write the following in it:

```text
Django~=3.2.10
```

Now we will use `requirements.txt` to trigger the Django boilerplate creation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
