# OOP Design Patterns in Python

Design patterns promise simple reusable solutions. They became one of the main topics of mainstream Computer Science in the late 90s. The so-called [Gang of Four](https://medium.com/codechai/what-is-gang-of-four-gof-5f55a6942913) defined some of the main patterns in their book called "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."

OOP design patterns form a catalog of code templates that describe popular interactions between objects of different classes.

In the first lesson on OOP design [patterns](/docs/week6/d5-s2), we compared them to archhitecture patterns, some of which should make more sense now:

- Layered pattern
- Client-server architecture
- Peer-to-peer pattern
- Model-view-controller(MVC)
- Presentation-abstraction-control(PAC)
- Model-view-presenter(MVP)
- Microservices
- Serverless

OOP design patterns fall into three main categories.

- [Creational Patterns](#creational-patterns)
- [Structural Patterns](d8-s2#structural-patterns)
- [Behavioral Patterns](d8-s2#behavioral-patterns)

## Creational Patterns

Creational Design Patterns deal with how the code creates objects of various classes. They define a controlled manner of object creation.

The following creational patterns are the most popular:

- [Simple Factory Pattern](#simple-factory-pattern)
- [Prototype Pattern](#prototype-pattern)
- [Singleton Pattern](#singleton-pattern)

### Simple Factory Pattern

Factory patterns have methods that create objects of different classes, often depending on a condition. There are various factory patterns. The following activity is for the Simple Factory Pattern.

The class diagram below describes a simple factory setup. A class diagram is a UML diagram that visualizes the relationships between classes. UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It is a visual language that helps software developers visualize systems. It peaked in popularity in the 1990s but remained an essential aspect of OOP theory. Please read more on UML [here](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/an-introduction-to-uml/).

#### tkinter

To build a mini-app described by the class diagram above, we will use `tkinter.` No one knows how to pronounce it; you are not alone. Some people te-kniter, others kinter or tinter. Choose the one you like.

[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) is a GUI library for Python. You can import it easily into standard Python.

Fork the replit below and try hacking the commented out tasks to learn how [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) works.

There is also a replit with some of the answers below:

Extra task:

Create your own [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) replit.

Use tkinter template on replit, not Python. Also, be warned that VSCode will need a lot of set up to write with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), an IDLE IDE is easier to use with [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

Build an interface that has some button that changes a label text. Read the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) docs to learn how to.

#### Simple Factory Sample Code

The Simple Factory excercise we will look at has the following base class:

```python
#base class Namer

class Namer():
    def __init__(self):
        self.last=""
        self.first=""
```

It has two derived classes. The first one, `FirstFirst` is triggered when the first and the second name are separated by a space, meaning the First Name was entered first.

```python
#derived from Namer class for First space Last
class FirstFirst(Namer):
    def __init__(self, namestring):
        super().__init__()
        i = namestring.find(" ") #find space between names
        if i > 0 :
            names = namestring.split()
            self.first = names[0]
            self.last = names[1]
        else:
            self.last = namestring
```

The second dervied class looks for a comma and assumes the last name coomoes first. It will make sense later.

```python
# derived from Namer class for Last then First

class LastFirst(Namer):
    def __init__(self, namestring):
        super().__init__()
        i = namestring.find(",")  # find a comma between names
        if i > 0 :
            names = namestring.split(",")
            self.last = names[0]
            self.first = names[1]
        else:
            self.last = namestring
```

Finally, a `NamerFactory()` class separates first and last names into different output boxes depending on whether a comma is present.

```python
class NamerFactory():
    def __init__(self, namestring):
        self.name = namestring
    def getNamer(self):
        i = self.name.find(",") # if it finds a comma
        if i>0:
            return LastFirst(self.name) # get the LastFirst class
        else:
            return FirstFirst(self.name) # else get the FirstFirst
```

There are/can be more interface classes but the three above explain the pattern.

### Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern copies and modifies instances of classes instead of creating them. It helps when creating a new class object is computationally expensive. Below is an example.

```python
from copy import deepcopy
import time

class Prototype(object):
    def clone(self):
        return deepcopy(self)

class NetworkConnector(Prototype):
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "expensive method here"
        time.sleep(5)
        print("object created")

obj = NetworkConnector()
print(obj.name)

obj2 = obj.clone()
print(obj2.name)
```

### Singleton Pattern

Singleton pattern is one of the easiest design patterns to understand. With this pattern there can be only one object of the class. For example, a computer system can have only one print spooler or only a single point of access to a database engine.

```python
class Car:
    _instance = None

    def getInstance():
        if Car._instance == None:
            Car()
        return Car._instance
    
    def __init__(self):
        if Car._instance != None:
            raise Exception("Singleton: there can only be one object")
        else:
            Car._instance = self

obj = Car()
print(obj)

obj2 = Car.getInstance()
print(obj2)
```
