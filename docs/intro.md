# External resources

## [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/)

You may try to use external resources to supplement this course. You do not have to. However, we would like to recommend some of the most helpful, just in case.

For Data Analytics, [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is probably the best. As a university student you can get free access to the **entire** [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/) curriculum, which otherwise can be pretty expensive. Make sure to get used to logging in with your university credentials to use [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/) for free. To start, give your NCH credential to your course leader, and they will add you to a [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/) classroom.

## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is awesome. However, its JavaScript pathways are better. Conversely, if you want to explore the D3 library, the ultimate data visualisation library for the web, you can look at the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) certificate in Data Visualisation.

You can check out the following [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) resources:

- [Free Code Camp Data Analytics curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)
- An e-book [Learning Python: From Zero to Hero](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-120ea540b567/)

## [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.dev/)

This website accompanies a Python Course on Frontend Masters, a subscription service for web developers. You need to subscribe and pay to watch videos, but you can look through the site. It has some useful "insider info," as a professional Python developer produced it.

## Conclusion

We will teach you a lot, but using some self-study resources is always helpful.
