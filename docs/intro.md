# Introduction to the course

This course is suitable for graduate students of disciplines other than computing who are keen to acquire new (or deepen existing) knowledge of programming.

## Welcome

Welcome to Object-Oriented design. The course will start with exploring some of the basic coding concepts and an introduction to Git and GitHub, the version control and collaboration tools.

We will use Python as our main programming language and we are hoping to teach some of the  advanced Python frameworks such as Django at the end of the course. We hope you enjoy the journey.

## GitHub welcome

One of the first technologies we will learn is called GitHub.

GitHub is the place coders store code and collaborate. Follow the link below, read more about GitHub in a document called README and raise your first issue.
