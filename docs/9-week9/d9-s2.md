# Django üîó‚Äçüí•

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework.

Read more about the framework on [Django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/).

When you have a website, you must have a server (machine) where it lives. When the server receives an incoming request, it sends back your website and you see it in the browser. Unlike a simple HTML app we made earlier, a Django app must have the server side as Python is a backend language, the browser does not understand Python. But we can make simple web apps with it.

## Django installation

Some Django tutorials recommend installing the framework globally, but we will follow the steps we followed before and install Django in a project's virtual environment. Both ways are possible but installing in a project's virtual environment is safer.

Our first project will be only local, no deployment, no GitHub.

First, make a project folder:

```bash
mkdir first-django
```

Navigate into it:

```bash
cd first-django
```

> Before we install Django we will get you to install an extremely useful tool to help keep your coding environment tidy on your computer. It's possible to skip this step, but it's highly recommended. Starting with the best possible setup will save you a lot of trouble in the future!
> So, let's create a virtual environment (also called a virtualenv). Virtualenv will isolate your Python/Django setup on a per-project basis. This means that any changes you make to one website won't affect any others you're also developing. Neat, right? (Django Girls)

Make a virtualenv called `myvenv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

Activate `myvenv`. By the way [this page](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/#working-with-virtualenv) has some ideas on what to do if `activate` does not work.

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Make sure we have the latest version of `pip`, the software that we use to install:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Inside the main project folder, make a file called `requirements.txt` and write the following in it:

```text
Django~=3.2.10
```

Now we will use `requirements.txt` to trigger the Django boilerplate creation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Django project

Now create the Django project

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite .
```

Guess what? You have a full stack project you can run!

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Django apps

Django project is a wrapper inside which you can have multiple apps. It will be visible in the folder structure.

```bash
python manage.py startapp httprequests
```

## Django `urls`

Explore the boilerplate's folder structure.
In the mysite subfolder find `urls.py`. Here we can specify the urls of our project, the endpoints. In Django they are called `paths`. Currently we only see admin. You can visit it by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser.

But we do not need admin yet. Modify `urls.py` as below:

```python
from django.urls import path
from httprequests import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

Everything should break. We told Djanngo to go to folder `views` and get function `home` but it does not exist yet.

## Django `views`

Django views are Python functions that take http requests and return responses, i.e., HTML code. A web page that uses Django has views with different tasks. Views are usually put in a file called `views.py` located on your app's folder. In our case it is the folder called `httprequests`. Find the file called `views.py`.

Modify it to contain the following code:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("lalalalala")
```

Now if you go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` it should greet you with "lalalalala."

## Endpoints of a web site

Modify `urls.py` as below:

```python
from django.urls import path
from httprequests import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('hello', views.hello, name='hello'),
]
```

Now modify `views.py` as below:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("lalalalala")

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1 style="color:blue;">hello lalalalala</h1>')
```

You can see lates file contents if you need from this [commit's files changed](https://github.com/EDGENortheastern/django-intro/commit/9e860301172d66d734e5e3c37fa5b88aaec974e2). You can see [the entire commit here](https://github.com/EDGENortheastern/django-intro/tree/9e860301172d66d734e5e3c37fa5b88aaec974e2).

You can see the site deployed [here](https://katianulondon.pythonanywhere.com/)

Now make your own endpoints that does whatever you like.

## Django templates

> A template is a file that we can re-use to present different information in a consistent format. You could use a template to help you write a letter because although each letter might contain a different message and be addressed to a different person, they will share the same format. A Django template's format is described in HTML. (Django Girls)

In other words if we needed to make an entire site like below it would be long. Also any CSS tutorial would tell you avoid using inline CSS.

```python
def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse('<h1 style="color:blue;">hello lalalalala</h1>')
```

To start making HTML templates you need a folder called `templates`.
It should be a subfolder of `httprequets`. Then make a subfolder in `templates` also called `httprequets`. Finally, make a file called `index.html`. Your relative path to `index.html` should be as below:

```text
httprequests/templates/httprequests/home.html
```

Copy and paste the codeblock below into `index.html`. CSS are coming from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

<div class="container text-center">
    <h1>Welcome my first Django web site!</h1>
</div>
```
