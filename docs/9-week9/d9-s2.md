# Structural and Behavioral Patterns

## Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns describe how classes and objects may be composed and grouped into larger structures.

Structural design patterns include:

- [The Adapter pattern](#the-adapter-pattern)
- The Bridge pattern
- The Composite pattern
- The Decorator pattern
- The Fa√ßade pattern
- The Flyweight pattern
- The Proxy pattern

You can learn more about any of the above from [this book](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-programming-with/9780137579921) available from Northeastern Library.

## The Adapter pattern

We use adapters when we want, for example, to plug European devices into British sockets. The Adapter deign pattern allows for unrelated classes to work together. The make an adapter we write a class that has the desired interface and then make it communicate with the class that has a different interface.

### The Adapter pattern replit task

Firstly, let us consider the `tkinter` app without an adapter. We will be working with aan interface that allows to input names into one list and then move them into another list.

You have to have the name you want to move selected to move it to the left. Also you have to click the Enter button first to get the name into the first list.

The adapter will get us a different display on the right side. It will utilise the [Treeview widget](https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-treeview/).

## Behavioral Patterns

In software engineering, behavioral design patterns decribe popular communication patterns between objects of classes.

- The Command Pattern
- [The Iterator Pattern](#the-iterator-pattern)
- The Memento Pattern
- The Observer Pattern
- [The State pattern](#the-state-pattern)

### The Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern uses an iterator to traverse a container. Often the container contains class objects.

[Python iterator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator) iterates through iterables.

This [Data Camp lesson](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2/using-iterators-in-pythonland?ex=1) explains it a bit better.

Please do this [Data Camp lesson](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2/using-iterators-in-pythonland?ex=1) as a **homework.**

Below is an example of an iterator OOP pattern. At home try to make an iterator pattern for objects that do someting rather than `pass`.

```python
class Car:
    pass

numbers = [Car(),Car(),Car(),Car()]

it = iter(numbers)

print(next(it))
print(next(it))
print(next(it))
```

### The State Pattern

Objects in real life can have various states, e.g., `on` and `off`.
This can be simulated in OOP using the state pattern. State is used in React, for example, a JavaScript framework and it works in a similar way. At home make your own state pattern to show the states of you.

```python
class ComputerState:
    name = "state"

    def switch(self, state):
        self.__class__ = state
        print(self.name)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class On(ComputerState):
    name = "on"

class Off(ComputerState):
    name = "off"

class Hibernate(ComputerState):
    name = "hibernate"

class Suspend(ComputerState):
    name = "suspend"
    
class Computer:
    def __init__(self):
        print('Computer')
        self.state = Off()

    def change(self, state):
        self.state.switch(state)

obj = Computer()
obj.change(On)
obj.change(Off)
obj.change(Hibernate)
obj.change(Suspend)
obj.change(On)
obj.change(On)
```
