# Django üîó‚Äçüí•

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework.

The [official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) has many small projects for you to try and if you want to try for a career in Python development you should build those, push to GitHub and deploy.

Another famous Django tutorial is from [Django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/). Again, you can follow it at home. I built it in 2017 and that version is still on [my GitHub](https://github.com/missKatiaPunter/my-blog-django).

## Web Tech intro

Django is a web project, so it helps to know some web tech to learn it. The main web technologies Django dev needs are:

- [HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-1)
- [CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-1)

The links above take you to Free Code Camp, the free and the best frontend curriculum. I strongly recommend doing as much of FCC as you can. Practice every day.

## Command line

Devs use the command line a lot. Let us remind some key commands.

Below is the command to print where you are (print working directory):

```bash
pwd
```

Below is the command to list all items in a folder:

```bash
ls
```

Below is the command to move into a folder `my-folder`:

```bash
cd  my-folder
```

Below is the command to move up a folder:

```bash
cd  ..
```

The tab key (‚Üí|) autocompletes.

## Check Python version

Below is the command to check Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Project folder

Below is the command to make a folder:

```bash
mkdir my-django
```
