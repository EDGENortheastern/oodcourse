# Intro to web apps with Python

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework.

The [official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/) has many small projects for you to try. If you want a career as a Python developer you should build those, push to GitHub, deploy. That would make a good portfolio. You should also have your own projects and Django ones are cool.

Another famous Django tutorial is from [Django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/). Again, you can follow it at home. I built it in 2017 and that version is still on [my GitHub](https://github.com/missKatiaPunter/my-blog-django).

## Web Tech intro

Django is a web project, so it helps to know some web tech first. The main web technologies Django dev needs are:

- [HTML](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/step-1)
- [CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/step-1)

The links above take you to Free Code Camp, the free and the best frontend curriculum. I strongly recommend doing as much of FCC as you can. Practice every day.

## Command line

Devs use the command line a lot. Let us remind some key commands.

Below is the command to print where you are (print working directory):

```bash
pwd
```

Below is the command to list all items in a folder:

```bash
ls
```

Below is the command to move into a folder `my-folder`:

```bash
cd  my-folder
```

Below is the command to move up a folder:

```bash
cd  ..
```

The tab key (â†’|) autocompletes in the terminal. The arrow up key brings up the previous command.

## Check Python version

Below is the command to check Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

or

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Project folder

Below is the command to make a folder:

```bash
mkdir my-django
```

Below is the command to delete a folder:

```bash
rm -rf my-django
```

### Task 1

Make some folders, delete them, open in VSCode, make files, navigate in and out.

### Task 2

Use what you learned from FCC to make an actual web site.

- Make a GitHub repository
- Clone it
- Navigate into it
- Open it in VSCode
- Make `index.html`
- Try with emmet: `!` and press tab
- Make `index.css`
- Add to `<head>` in index.html - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">`
- Get a Live Server VSCode extension, run your site
- Add some html
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Adds html"`
- `git push`
- Add some css
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Adds css"`
- `git push`

If your emmet does not work here are some templates:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css">
    <title>My first ever site</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Welcome to my first ever site</h1>
        <h2>HTML is fun</h1>
        <p class="output-field"></p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

And now the CSS one:

```css
* {
    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
}

body {
    background-color: plum;
}

h1 {
    color: rgb(7, 93, 27);
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

h2 {
    color: rgb(148, 19, 181);
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    text-align: center;
}

.container {
    max-width: 40rem;
    background-color: bisque;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 3rem auto;
    padding: 1rem;
}

.output-field {
    color: rgb(87, 1, 1);
    text-transform: capitalize;
    font-size: larger;
}
```

If you would like to try JS you can build this [app](https://github.com/EDGENortheastern/HTML-CSS-JS-sample).

Remember to do this when you completed a task:

- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Adds container styles"`
- `git push`

On the GitHub repository site go to `Settings` and add GitHub Pages. You web app is live.
