# More Django üîó‚Äçüí•

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework.

Read more about the framework on [Django girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/).

## Django workflow to a GitHub repo

Make a remote repository (GitHub), clone to your local, for example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EDGENortheastern/django-intro.git
```

Navigate into it:

```bash
cd django-intro
```

Make a virtualenv called `myvenv`.

```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

Activate `myvenv`. By the way [this page](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/#working-with-virtualenv) has some ideas on what to do if `activate` does not work.

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Make sure we have the latest version of `pip`, the software that we use to install:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Inside the main project folder, make a file called `requirements.txt` and write the following in it:

```text
Django~=3.2.10
```

Now we will use `requirements.txt` to trigger the Django boilerplate creation.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Django project

Now create the Django project

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite .
```

Guess what? You have a full stack project you can run!

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Django apps

Django project is a wrapper inside which you can have multiple apps. It will be visible in the folder structure.

```bash
python manage.py startapp httprequests
```

## Django `urls`

Explore the boilerplate's folder structure.
In the mysite subfolder find `urls.py`. Here we can specify the urls of our project, the endpoints. In Django they are called `paths`. Currently we only see admin. You can visit it by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` in your browser.

But we do not need admin yet. Modify `urls.py` as below:

```python
from django.urls import path
from httprequests import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('hello', views.hello, name='hello'),
]ss
```

Everything should break. We told Djanngo to go to folder `views` and get function `home` but it does not exist yet.

## Django `views`

Django views are Python functions that take http requests and return responses, i.e., HTML code. A web page that uses Django has views with different tasks. Views are usually put in a file called `views.py` located on your app's folder. In our case it is the folder called `httprequests`. Find the file called `views.py`.

Modify it to contain the following code:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'httprequests/home.html')

def hello(request):
    the_name = request.GET.get('name')
    return render(request, 'httprequests/hello.html', {'name':the_name})
```
