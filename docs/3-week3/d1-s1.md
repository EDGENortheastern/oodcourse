## Pair programming and ticketing recap

### Revising ticktes on GitHub Projects

Last lesson we looked and pair programming to complete the tickets.
Check out the repo and the project.

### Revising air programming

Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers work [together at one workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

The advantages of pair programming are:

- Fewer bugs 🦋🪳🪲
- Bugs caught early 🪳🪲
- Learning from each other 🧑🏽‍💻👩‍💻
- Learning to respect each other 👩‍💻🧑🏿‍💻
- Less stress per dev 📉
- Collaboration: better, more efficient code 📈
- Collaboration, better quality code (more readable, adhering to good style) 📈
- Collaboration, two juniors can solve a mid-level task together 👩‍💻🧑🏿‍💻

## Driver and navigator 🏎️

There are many models of pair programming. One of them is called **"Driver and Navigator."**

The Driver is the person at the keyboard. They focus on details and smaller goals. A driver should talk and explain what they are doing.

The Navigator is the observer, while the Driver is typing. They give directions, and spot bugs, e.g., typos.

When the task gets very challenging, the Driver and the Navigator freestyle to find the best solution. Talk, draw, jump. Don't fight, though.

### Pair programming with Codewars Task

Choose some kata(s) from this [curated list](https://www.codewars.com/collections/python-beginner-katas-comprehensive) and pair prgram some solutions.

## Functional programming paradigm and pure functions

Functional programming has been around for a very long time (60 years or more).

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the primary method of computation is using pure functions.

> What other programming paradigms are there?

A pure function is a function whose output uses only input values, without any side effect.

To understand side effects it is important to understand local and global variables.

## Global variables

Variables that are created outside of a function are global variables. Let us consider the following code:

```python
my_global = "Hello"

def myfunc():
  print(my_global,", Python") # this function returns nothing - it is a procedure

myfunc()
```

The code above will work and will not produce any errors.
However, global variables can cause serious bug, for example:

```python
my_global = "Hello"
def myfunc2():
  my_global = my_global + ", Python"
  print(my_global)

myfunc2()
```

The function above is trying to change a global variable. Python is a functional language, so it stops the coder from writing such code and hte code will break.

To fix the bug shown above you can code like that:

```python
def myfunc3():
  global my_global
  my_global = my_global + ", Python"
  print(my_global)

myfunc3()
```

To illustrate more side effects let us look at Python lists as globals.

```python
my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Kevin", "Jacob"]

def myfunc4():
  global my_list
  my_list.sort()
  print(my_list)

myfunc4()
print(my_list)
```

The `sort()` function is mutating the list (changes the original list). So, the function actually changes the global variable and other functions will get its new value even if they need the old one.

## Local variables

A local variable is a variable that is only accessible within a specific part of a program, e.g., inside the function. Local variables are defined within that function.

Local variables cannot be used by other functions. However, they allow to eliminate bugs. For a value to be passed from one function to another coders use parameter passing.

Let us look at a local variable example:

```python
my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Aba", "Jacob"]

def myfunc4():
  my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Aba", "Jacob"]
  my_list.sort()
  print(my_list)

myfunc4()
print(my_list)
```

The code above uses a local variable `my_list`. The function sorts the local variable. The global value stays as it was.

> Note: local variables can have the same names as locals in other functions. It does not affect the code, it is fine.

## Functions and tests

One of the advantages of using functions is the fact that we can test functions.
Automated testing means that we can make software that would run functions for us with certain parameters and compare expected and actual output. That is how codewars works.

Normally, tests are written as separate files. For example, if we write the function body in a file `subtract.py`:

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2
```

we can test this function with the following test, also written in its own file:

```python
import pytest #imports testing framework

from subtraction import subtract_nums #imports funtion

def test_subtract_nums():
    assert subtract_nums(10,5) == 5

```

To start using a ttesting framework you need to import pytest:

```bash
pip3 install pytest
```
