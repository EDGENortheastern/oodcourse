# Sort, filter, map, reduce

## Some codewars

Solve some katas with list comprehensions.

1. Python: [List comprehension](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a083a57cb1f31db7000028/python)

2. Python: [List comprehension](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53dbd5315a3c69eed20002dd/python)

## `.sort()`

Python `.sort()` method sorts values in a list. It affects the original list. `sort()` is a mutating function.

```python
a = [3, 2, 1]
print(a.sort()) # in place
print(a)
```

The code above will print [1, 2, 3] and it will have changed the list a itself.

## Sorted

Python `sorted()` method also sorts values in a list. However, it does not affect the original list. Please pay attention that sorted takes parameter that is a list, whereas `sort()` is chained to the list.

```python
a = [3, 2, 1]
print(sorted(a)) # new list
print(a)
```

## Sorted, sort and lambdas

Both sorted and sort can be used with lambda functions. Lambdas are used to show how to sort. Can you figure what the code below does?

```python
data = ["Alex", "Katia", "Grace", "Gus", "Aba", "Jahia"]
data.sort()
print(sorted(data, key = lambda ch: ch[1]))
```

## Filter

Filter method allows to filter lists without writing loops. Filter also works with lambdas. It is a non-mutating method.

```python
my_list = [2,4,6,7,8,9]
new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0), my_list))
print(new_list)
```

The code above adds all values in a list.

## Map

Map method allows to alter lists without writing loops. Map also works with lambdas. It is also a non-mutating method.

```python
my_list = [2,4,6,7,8,9]
new_list = list(map(lambda x: x+2, my_list))
print(new_list)
```

The code above adds 2 to every value on a list.

## Reduce

Reduce is yet another method of functional programming. It reduces a list to a single value. A parameter function determines how to reduce.

```python
from functools import reduce
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_list = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, numbers)
print(new_list)
```
