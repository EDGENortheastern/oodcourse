# One line solutions

Functional programming is more than just not using global variables.

Another key feature of functional programming is the fact that we can pass functions as parameter to other functions. As a data analyst you will often do that in Pandas.

In order to make it easier Python introduced a lambda function.

We will start with learning how to write lambdas.

## Shorter functions

Good code is readable, but not verbose.

A good solution to odd or even problem is below:

```python
def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'
```

## Lambda functions

A one-line solution to the problem above is here:

```python
even_or_odd = lambda number: "Odd" if number % 2 else "Even"
```
