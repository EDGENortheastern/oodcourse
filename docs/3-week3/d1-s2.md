# One line solutions

Functional programming is more than just not using global variables.

Another key feature of functional programming is the fact that we can pass functions as parameter to other functions. As a data analyst you will often do that in Pandas.

In order to make it easier Python introduced a lambda function.

We will start with learning how to write lambdas.

## Shorter functions

Good code is readable, but not verbose.

A good solution to odd or even problem is below:

```python
def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'
```

## Lambda functions

A one-line solution to the problem above is here:

```python
even_or_odd = lambda number: "Odd" if number % 2 else "Even"
```

## Algorithmic Complexity and Comprehensions

Computational complexity is a computer science concept that focuses on the amount of resources needed for tasks.

In computational complexity theory, researchers assess the kinds of resources that will be needed for a given type of task to classify different kinds of tasks into various levels of complexity.

### Some codewars

2. Python statistics: [Min and max](https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a98a6ae28071780000989/python)

3. Python imperative: [Is it odd?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555a67db74814aa4ee0001b5/python)

## Complexity of tasks above

Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity).

Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm.

The Big-O notations we will consider are: O(1) - constant, O(n) - linear and O(n¬≤) - quadratic. There are more of those.

### Constant Big-O or O(1)

The last kata we solved is O(1), e.g.,

```python
def is_even(n): 
    return n%2 == 0
```

The algorithm above always makes exactly one operation as it always get the same amount of data.

### Linear Big-O or O(n)

An algorithm is said to take linear time, or O(n) time when the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. A classic linear algorithm is a single loop that loops over an array. The bigger the array the more operations are needed.

From the codewars above the first task was linear:

```python
def create_array(n):
    res=[]
    i=1
    while i<=n:
        res+=[i]
        i+= 1
    return res
```

### Quadratic Big-O or O(n¬≤)

A classic example of O(n¬≤) is operating on matrices.

```python
my_list_of_lists = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]

for i in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists)):
    for j in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists[i])):
        my_list_of_lists[i][j] += 1

print(my_list_of_lists)
```

The code above uses a loop inside a loop in order to reach every value in a matrix. As a matrix gets bigger the time complexity will increase directly proportionally to the squared size of input.

## List comprehensions

List comprehensions offer a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

```python
my_list = [2,4,5,7]
new_list = [2**x for x in my_list ]
print(new_list)
```

The code above will print [4, 16, 32, 128].

## NumPy - another way to solve complex tasks in Python

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) NumPy stands for Numerical Python; it is a scientific computing package. It is mostly used for array computing, however, it also has many advanced mathematical functions.

The Data Science convention prescribes importing NumPy as so:

```python
import numpy as np
```

NumPy methods can then be used as so:

```python
rand_num = np.random.randint(0,10) #generates a random integer
```

## `np.array()`

**NumPy Array** is one of the key data structures for Data Analysts. It:

- is more efficient than a list (faster, more Pythonic, and has less memory footprint)
- homogenous
- allows operating on a set of values at one time (vectorized arithmetic operations)
- allows masking and filtering on a set of values without using loops or filter### Definition



## Vector arithmetics

If a plus sign is used on two lists, they get concatenated.

Data Analysts often need to operate on all values in a data set. To make it easier, NumPy arrays allow performing vectorised arithmetics, e.g., operations on all values in arrays.

## Boolean NumPy arrays

Boolean NumPy arrays work as masks. They allow one-line filtering of array values. Pandas data frames are filtered in a similar way.
