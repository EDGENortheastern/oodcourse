# Software Engineering and OOP

Software Engineering is an academic discipline exploring software ideation, design, development, and maintenance. It links the world of technology with traditional engineering philosophies and practices and intertwines closely with the software industry.

It is not untrue to say that Software Engineering is a branch of Computer Science. However, while Computer Science studies the symbolic representation of automated processing, Software Engineering teaches to develop applications supporting organisational processes. That is why Software Engineering is richer in methods than in theory.

The common subsection of Software Engineering are outlined below. Some name more, others name different branches of this discipline. Software Engineering is an evolving academic subject, constantly changing with the industry.

## SOLID Design

SOLID is a set of design principles developed by Robert C. Martin in a 2000 essay, “Design Principles and Design Patterns.”  SOLID principles are prevalent in object-oriented software development.

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

- single responsibility principle
- open-closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- interface segregation principle
- dependency inversion principle.

The broad goal of the SOLID principles is to reduce dependencies so that engineers change one area of software without impacting others. Additionally, it makes designs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
