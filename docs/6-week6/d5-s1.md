# Principles of Object-Oriented Design

## OOP üèõÔ∏è

The four main theoretical principles of object-oriented programming are:

- [abstraction](#abstraction)
- [encapsulation](#encapsulation)
- [polymorphism](#polymorphism)
- [inheritance](#inheritance)

### Abstraction

Abstraction means hiding the internal details. Abstraction describes things in simple, general terms.

Values are real, variables are abstract.

The fundamental concepts of OOP are objects and classes. Objects are real, classes are abstract.
Classes are blueprints, templates for objects. They describe states and behaviors that objects could have. For example, if you say "every employee will have a name and a salary, and will be able to get a raise", you have defined a class.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

```python
class Label:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self._text = text
        self._font = font

    def get_text(self):
        return self._text

    def set_text(self, value):
        self._text = value
```

In the example above you define getter and setter methods for the `text` attribute.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.

Method overloading is an implementation of polymorphism. When we have one or more methods with the same name and/or return but different parameter lists, then we say we have ‚Äúoverloaded‚Äù the initial method.

The `BankAccount` class below overloads the `__eq__` methods to return `True` if the number attribute is the same for two objects and the type() of both objects is the same.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, number, balance=0):
        self.number, self.balance = number, balance
      
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount 

    # MODIFY to add a check for the type()
    def __eq__(self, other):
        return (self.number == other.number and type(self) == type(other))

acct = BankAccount(873555333)
pn = Phone(873555333)
print(acct == pn)
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to customize functionality of existing classes without having to re-implement methods from scratch.
