# Object Orientation

Object Orientation is yet another programming approach (paradigm).

Objects allow us to store data, known as *properties* or *atttributess*, as well as functions specific to that object, known as *methods*.

In the below example, a book object will have a number of different variables within it. The methods provide an *interface* for this object.

Effectively, putting data and methods within objects will allow the data to be neatly separated. 

This is a process called *encapsulation* - think of a capsule hotel, with different pods.

Objects can be used as the basis for other objects. This is a process known as *extension*. 
Extension allows us to use our earlier work as a basis.

We can have a book, and then a bunch of other types of books - a textbook, a novel, etc. There will be some shared properties and methods, so we can pull these out into our core book class.

You should see similarities between what we have been doing here, and what we were doing with data models. Constructing classes and constructing tables have similar processes. We can also use this concept - extension - in our work with databases.

At the same time, it is important to note that tables just store data - objects also have actions that they can take, and can provide rules or mechanisms for interacting with that data.

Note that as a data analyst, we are not required to use object oriented programming in practice often. Python has simplified the mechanism for creating and working with objects, and dictionaries are often easier to work with. Dictionaries in Python can store functions, so they can include both texts and methods.

At the same time, object oriented programming is valuable as it underlies the design of many of the modules - the tools we have been using. It also rounds out our knowledge of programming techniques.
