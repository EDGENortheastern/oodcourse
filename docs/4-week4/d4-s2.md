# Modules and Classes

## OOP

Some of the principles of OOP are:

- there classes and objects
- attributes are data describing the state of the object
- methods are functions that describe the behavior of an object

Bundling data (variables, attributes) with actions (methods, functions) together opposes the principle of functional programming, where the preferred way of passing data is parameter passing between functions.

## Classes

OOP utilizes classes. Classes are blueprints for objects. They define states and behaviors that every object of a certain class will have. For example, when you say "every customer has an email attribute and can place and cancel orders," you have defined a class.

Classes are abstract. They define methods and attributes, but we need to create objects based on classes to use those methods and attributes. Below is an example of a class:

```python
class Dog:
    def identify(self, name):
        print("I am " + name)
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof, woof")
```

If one attempts to call the class by its name as we do with functions, e.g., `Dog()`, they will get an error. To run the code of a class we need to make an object based on this class.

The process of creating an object based on a class is called instantiation.

```python
my_dog = Dog() # instantiation 
```

## Methods

Python class attributes contain state information, whereas methods define the behavior.

Simply put, methods are functions. Python is an OOP language, and many of its frameworks, e.g., Pandas are use classes, attributes, and methods.

In Python, the terms functions and methods are often used interchangeably.

To make a method of an object run dot notation and parenthesis are used.

```python
my_dog.bark() # calls method .bark() of object my_dog based on class Dog()
```

## Attributes

Attributes (or states) in Python objects are represented by variables. Variables do not use `()`. Methods, or behaviors, are represented by functions, they use `()`. Both are accessible from an object using the dot syntax.

In the class `Dog()` the state was not stored. To define the class `Dog()` that stores the name we need extra variables and also extra methods. It is better to change the class definition:

```python
class Dog:
    def set_name(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name
    def identify(self):
        print("I am " + name)
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof, woof")
```

Now method `set_name()` gets the value for dog's name and an atttribute name stores that attribute.

```python
my_dog = Dog() # instantiation
my_dog.set_name("Bobo") # calling method set_name with parameter 
```

The code above instantiates the class, creates an object based on class `Dog()` and updates the attribute `.name` via a method `.set_name()`.

Finally, to see the content of attribute `.name` use:

```python
my_dog.name
```

Pay attention to the fact that attributes do not have parenthesis, methods do.

## Attribute or method

Now it should be clear when and why we need parenthesis in Pandas.

```python
df.shape # prints the attribute shape
```

```python
df.info() # calls the methhod info() of a data frame
```
